# CODXQL-Server-Admin
CODXQL is a Server Administation package which is set of .GSX (Game Script Extended) Scripts. This package can be used as an administrative tool to control your server and clients. For those who have difficulties to install or dont like to install 3rd party administrative tools, can use this package for their server;. Just by quick configs.

## Features

- Aliases Recording System
- Client Settings Recording System
- Administrative system with Admin Commands
- Client commands
- XLR Stats system (This system is a port from BigBrotherBot app)

## Note
This system does not have a dedicated admin classes system (supper admin, admin, moderator etc.) yet. But this system supports with integrated admin system of COD4X.

## Requirments
- COD4x Server version Same or Older than v17.6
- COD4x MySQL Plugin on [Github repo](https://github.com/callofduty4x/mysql)
- CODXQL Addition plugin on [Github repo](https://github.com/thamidu)

This system doesn't support with the new COD4x version (v17.7) because there is a compatibility issue with MySQL plugin with the new version. Until the developers fix that issue, this system will only support Maximum v17.6 version. After they fix it I will update the system and Readme.
